      <p>Yooo this is my first webpage! I am siked to see this all come together. 
        I like that the elements and attributes are different colors. It is very pleasant to look at. 
        Anyways yeah this is my first project and I look forward to progressing and making more complex sites. 
        I appreciate the good info and teaching style.
